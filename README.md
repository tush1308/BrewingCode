This Project helps the small-scale entrepreneurs to avail a heavy discount while purchasing raw materials from their suppliers. This uses the concept of mass buying where these small-scale business collaborate and place the order. So the discount amount increases which allows them to sell items at a rate lower then Maximum Retail Price and even earn higher profits.

We have tried our best to create a website where small-scale businesses can register themselves and collaborate with others to place the orders. The entrepreneurs will have their identity hidden so it won't be visible to other buyers with whom are they collaborating. This will allow the buyers to freely place the order without any fear of competitors.

The buyers have to request for the item and the quantity they require. After placing the request the user has to wait till some more requests for the same order arrives and the order quantity increases.
So if higher the order quantity higher will be the available discount. There can be a threshold quantity beyond which if the quantity increases the buyers will be eligible for the discount. If the buyer wants to buy before threshold quantity is reached then he will not be eleigible for any discount.

Here we have also introduced the seller interface where the seller will be able to add their items on the site for selling it in wholesale. The seller can also add the category filter on his items so it becomes easy for the buyers to browse for their requirements.

Here I have attached some screenshots of the project:

SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT:-
1. The seller can set the customized discount on each product so it becomes more affordable for     buyers.
2. We can also provide the user discount based on the pincode of the location. So if multiple users from the same pincode order their requirements then they are eligible for an extra discount.
3. If a particular user places a order in bulk then he will be eligible for a bonus discount.
4. Buyer could also be given a discount based on the quantity of items in the same item category
5. This project can also be extended by adding the refund policy if the user has paid and then cancelled his order.
